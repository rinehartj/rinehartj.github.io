Hello! My name is Jason Rinehart and I possess a diverse history in sensors, microcontrollers, and programming.I hold a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from Wentworth Institute of Technology. 

### Two words to describe my ideal job:
- **portable**: I would be on my feet to carry out the majority of my responsibilities, either in a lab or in the field.
- **pliable**: My responsibilities may shift as project guidelines are reviewed and refined.
