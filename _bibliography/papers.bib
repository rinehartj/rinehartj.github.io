  title={Preliminary Design and Prototype for a 1P PocketQube Earth Observation Satellite},
  author={Shanley, Kieran M and Rinehart, Jason R and Marnell, Trout G and Blanchard, Patrick R and Sonntag, Michael C and Jan, Noran and Dow, Douglas E and Aveta, Federica and Basnet, Saurav},
  abstract={This paper describes a proposed design for a 1P PocketQube Earth observation satellite being developed by undergraduate students at Wentworth Institute of Technology. This satellite will push boundaries in satellite miniaturization, image sensors, and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. By proving a new set of PocketQube hardware, future missions should carry less risk. Special care was taken to design measures to prevent, mitigate, or recover from the effects of ionizing radiation. An attitude determination and control system (ADCS) using embedded magnetorquer was designed to give authority over the pointing of the camera payload; allowing for more frequent imaging and live adjustments of image target.},

  title={Client-Server Radar Security Circuit},
  author={Rinehart, Jason R and Huynh, Trinh and Basnet, Saurav and Dow, Douglas E},
  abstract={This paper aims to aid in solving inherent problems with modern intrusion security systems. With the entry of microcontrollers in every angle of our lives, it may be surprising that home security is a sector that almost always has trade-offs when it comes to features and cost. The system established in this paper is a basic but expandable attempt at a cost-effective home security system, also functional in commercial and industrial environments. The designs prototyped in this paper demonstrate the implementation of a radar sensor to detect high accuracy movement within 36 feet. Then the notification of movement can be sent via phone notification, alarm buzzer, and screen display text. To mitigate false alarms in an outdoor setting, the design recognizes short and long movements in order to take appropriate actions. The control panel and remote sensor use Raspberry Pi and Particle Photon microcomputers respectively, which work together over Wi-Fi. With wireless ability, several remote sensors may be placed within range to enable a full home monitor system for an attractive cost.},
